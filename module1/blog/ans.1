TypeScript is a widely used statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides developers with a 
range of powerful features to improve code safety and maintainability. Two key features of TypeScript 
are union and intersection types, which offer developers the ability to create versatile and resilient 
type definitions for their projects. These features empower developers to craft code that is more 
adaptable and less prone to errors, ultimately enhancing the overall quality and reliability of their applications.
